<title>The Bucket List</title>

## The Bucket List

The bucket list was started back in February, 2013. The idea is to create a list of all the things that I'd like to accomplish and experience over the years.

I hope this list being in a public place will want people to experience these with me. This list is ever growing, shrinking, and changing (and yes, was inspired by the movie)

### Outstanding

<ul>
  <Item client:only="react" title="Scuba dive the Great Barrier Reef">
    This one is kind of funny.  Things that are so close to your doorstep you don't tend to do.
    I'm now half way around the world and this will likely be the "Good Barrier Reef" before I get a chance to do it.
  </Item>
  <Item client:only="react" title="Paramotor Horseshoe Bend">
    I'd need to learn to Paramotor first.

    Paragliding is definitely a passion these days.  This looks amazing though!

  <Item client:only="react" title="Picnic under a tree watching clouds from above">
      This one is going to seem silly.  I'd like it to be a very low cloud day, so we can watch the clouds rise, looking like big marshmallows from above while relaxing with a picnic rug, under a tree, for hours.

      [Here's a picture from Dall-E](https://labs.openai.com/s/9frUj3jGbZc6FAKE86vXY17b) that does a pretty good job to show it

  <Item client:only="react" title="See flowing lava">
    Bethany and I got to see flowing lava at the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii. This was just before the 2018 eruptions, so got lucky with our timing. Due to there not being flowing lava at the time, we only saw this from afar. I would very much like to keep this on the bucket list in hope of one day seeing it free-flowing up close.

  </Item>
  <Item client:only="react" title="Bake a loaf of sourdough from Scratch (more scratch than you'd imagine)">
    I'd like to bake a loaf of sourdough from scratch.  It contains three ingredients; Flour, Water, Salt.
    I'd like to grow my own wheat for the flour, and collect my own salt from the ocean.

  <Item client:only="react" title="Fly a plane (Completed early 2012)">
    This one is interesting. Something I always wanted to do. I've been very
    fortunante to have had a number of pilot friends let me take controls over
    the years. It's amazing, but, far too expensive for me to want to pick up.
    I'll stick with Paragliding
  </Item>
  <Item client:only="react" title="Fly a glider">
    Got to complete it on November 2018. Went with Sam, Nick and Jay and did a
    lesson day at Hollister. Loved it, but far too expensive as a hobby. I'm
    very much into Paragliding now as a cheaper source of flying the skies
